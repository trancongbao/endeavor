# Decks

Each deck corresponds to a course.  
Each deck includes a set of sub-decks. 
Each sub-deck corresponds to a lesson in the course.  
All sub-decks are initially locked: a sub-deck will be unlocked for reviewing once the student has finished the corresponding lesson.

## Sub-deck

Each sub-deck includes a set of flash-cards.

## Flash-card

Each flash-card includes a front and a back.

### Front

The front displays sentences that contain the targeted words/phrases, with  accompanying audio/video.  
Targeted words are highlighted.
> Note for teacher:  
The sentences should be long enough to provide a 'good' context, but should not be too long.  
A targeted word/phrase should be in many cards, depending on difficulty, for better retention. However, there should only be one or two targeted words/phrases in any given card. If there are more than two words that are either new or not already in 'enough' cards, try search for those words in other sentences (maybe in other lessons/courses).

### Back

The back displays set of explanation of the targeted words.
